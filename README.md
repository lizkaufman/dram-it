# Dram It! 

**Update 05/02/2021 - Unfortunately, it looks like the neglected whisky API I was using for this eight months ago is down, so this app no longer works. :( If I find another whisky API (or build one one day!), I'll resurrect this project though! :(**

Whisky suggestion app using the slightly dodgy and neglected API [here](https://evening-citadel-85778.herokuapp.com/docs/). If anyone finds a better whisky API, please tell me!

Hosted here: https://dram-it.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My main initial goals with the MVP version in regular React: 
- Practice using Figma and sharpening my design skills, properly wireframing/designing the whole app before I started to build. (View my initial design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ibQI54URpxdEZwoXxjYVdI/Dram-It?node-id=4%3A23).)
- Keep practicing working with APIs and objects/data structures/JSONs.
- Keep my React skills from going rusty (for example, more complicated hooks like useReducer).
- Implement lazy loading/Suspense component for the whisky result component for a smoother UX while the API fetches the recommendation.

## Future plans: 

If this API plays nicely for something small like this, I might expand this into a React Native app and add additional features.

Also, I'd quite like to add functionality where a user can save whisky suggestions they've received to a list they can pull up when they're shopping. This could either be via a proper back end with login or local storage.
